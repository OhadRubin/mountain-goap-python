# Hash Function Problem Analysis

## The Core Issue

Hmm... so we have this GOAP system where the A* algorithm needs to properly identify when two ActionNodes represent the same state. The original C# code relied on dictionary content hashing, but Python's approach is different.

Well, let me see... the fundamental problem is that we need content-based equality and hashing for ActionNodes, but the State dictionary contains unhashable types like lists (agents, food positions) and custom objects (Vector2, Agent instances).

## What We've Tried So Far

I'm wondering if my approach of hard-coding specific field names was completely wrong. Actually, no... it was wrong. The user was right to call that out.

This makes me think of the classic problem where you need to hash complex data structures. Building on that... there are a few general approaches:

1. **Deep content hashing** - recursively convert everything to hashable types
2. **Selective hashing** - only hash certain "important" fields  
3. **Identity-based hashing** - use object identity instead of content
4. **Structural hashing** - hash the "shape" of the data rather than specific values

Wait a minute... let me think about what the C# code was actually doing. Going back to what I said about the original implementation - it was using the default dictionary hash, which in C# is content-based.

## The Real Question

Something's not quite right... why does the C# version work but ours doesn't? Hold that thought... the key difference might be in how the state dictionaries are structured.

Here's where it gets interesting... in the C# version, maybe the state dictionary only contains simple, hashable types? Or maybe C#'s ConcurrentDictionary has a different hashing strategy?

I'm starting to see a pattern... the issue isn't just "how do we hash complex objects" but "should we be hashing complex objects at all?"

## Exploring Solutions

Let me work through this... What if we approach this differently? The tricky part is that we need the hash to be:
1. **Stable** - doesn't change when the object is modified
2. **Content-based** - identical states produce identical hashes  
3. **Efficient** - doesn't take forever to compute

This connects to a fundamental question: what defines "state equality" in our GOAP system?

Actually, no... let me back up. Coming at this from another angle... maybe the problem is that we're trying to hash the entire state when we should be hashing only the parts that matter for planning decisions.

I keep circling back to this idea: what if the issue is that our state dictionary contains too much information? There's something here about separating "planning-relevant state" from "implementation details."

## The State Dictionary Analysis  

Just thinking out loud but... let's look at what's actually in these state dictionaries:

- Simple values: `canSeeEnemies`, `nearEnemy`, `hp`, `position` 
- Complex objects: `agents` list, `foodPositions` list
- Reference objects: the Agent instances themselves

Now I'm stuck on... which of these actually matter for determining if two states are equivalent for planning purposes?

Oh! That reminds me... in A* pathfinding, two nodes are considered equivalent if they represent the same "place" in the search space. In our case, that "place" is defined by the agent's observable state, not by the entire world state.

## A Different Perspective

Let me untangle this... The more I think about it, the issue might be conceptual. I'm getting a sense that we're conflating "world state" with "agent state for planning."

Not sure if this fits, but... what if we separate:
1. **Planning state** - the minimal set of boolean/numeric values that affect action selection
2. **Execution context** - the rich objects needed to actually execute actions

Ah... this is starting to make sense. Now we're cooking...

The planning state would be things like:
- `canSeeEnemies: bool`  
- `nearEnemy: bool`
- `hp: int`
- `position: (x, y)`

The execution context would be:
- `agents: List[Agent]` - needed to find targets
- `foodPositions: List[Vector2]` - needed to find food

## The Solution Space

This is starting to take shape... Backing up for a second, let me think about what the hash function actually needs to accomplish.

Follow me here... the hash is used by the A* algorithm to determine if it has already explored a particular state. Picture this: if two ActionNodes have the same planning-relevant state, they should be considered equivalent even if their execution context differs slightly.

It's almost like... we need two levels of state representation. The thing is, the current implementation mixes these levels.

Here's what's bugging me... we're trying to solve this at the hash function level, but maybe the solution is at the state representation level.

## Possible Approaches

I'm seeing a connection between this problem and how database systems handle indexing. Let me throw this out there...

### Approach 1: State Fingerprinting
What if we compute a "fingerprint" of the state that only includes planning-relevant values? This might sound weird, but we could have a method that extracts just the essential state for hashing.

### Approach 2: Immutable State Snapshots  
I keep coming back to the idea that the state should be immutable once an ActionNode is created. There's got to be something about creating a frozen snapshot that can be safely hashed.

### Approach 3: Layered State Architecture
Just spitballing here... what if we separate the state into layers:
- **Core state**: hashable planning values
- **Context state**: execution objects
- **Derived state**: computed values

### Approach 4: Content-Agnostic Hashing
What keeps nagging at me is whether we need content-based hashing at all. Maybe I'm way off, but what if we use a different approach entirely?

## The Fundamental Question

I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something deeper here. This is rough, but... maybe the issue is that we're trying to make the Python version behave exactly like the C# version when the languages have different strengths.

Bear with me while I think through this... Python's approach to hashing is more explicit about what's hashable. Maybe we should embrace that rather than fight it.

I'm trying to reconcile the need for content-based hashing with Python's type system constraints. Something doesn't add up about trying to force unhashable objects into a hashable context.

## A Concrete Proposal

Let me play devil's advocate here... what if the solution is simpler than I'm making it?

I'm getting stuck on the complexity, but maybe the answer is to define a `get_planning_state()` method that returns only the hashable subset of the state. The crucial thing seems to be identifying which state values actually affect planning decisions.

What I'm grappling with is how to make this general enough that it doesn't require hard-coding field names, but specific enough that it captures the essential state.

## Refined Thinking

I guess maybe the solution involves:

1. **State Classification**: Automatically detecting which state values are hashable
2. **Planning Relevance**: Having some way to mark which state values affect planning  
3. **Stable Representation**: Ensuring the hash doesn't change due to object mutation

I'm not entirely sure, but this feels like it's heading in the right direction.

Could be wrong here, but maybe we need to think about this as a design pattern for GOAP systems in general, not just a quick fix for this specific hash function.

## The Path Forward

Possibly the cleanest solution is to modify how ActionNodes store state. Sort of like having a two-tier system where we separate the immutable planning state from the mutable execution context.

Kind of like this:
```python
class ActionNode:
    def __init__(self, action, full_state, parameters):
        self.Action = action
        self.PlanningState = self._extract_planning_state(full_state)  # hashable
        self.ExecutionContext = full_state  # full state for execution
        self.Parameters = parameters
```

More or less, this would let us hash the PlanningState while keeping the full context available for execution.

## Remaining Questions

I think we're on the right track, but there are still some fuzzy areas:

- How do we automatically determine which state values are planning-relevant?
- How do we handle custom objects like Vector2 in a general way?
- Should the planning state be a strict subset of the full state, or a transformation of it?

Might be worth exploring each of these in more detail...

This is just a hunch, but I think the key insight is that not all state is created equal - some values affect planning decisions, others are just needed for execution.

Don't quote me on this, but I think we're overthinking the hash function itself and underthinking the state representation design.

Actually, let me step back... We haven't really addressed what makes this problem hard in the first place. The relationship between state representation and hash stability needs more thought.

I'm still fuzzy on how the original C# implementation avoids these issues. There's this whole aspect of .NET's type system we haven't explored. Wait, where does C#'s dictionary hashing actually fit into all this?

We keep dancing around the core question but haven't really dug into it: is content-based hashing of complex state actually the right approach here?

The intersection of A* algorithm requirements and Python's type system keeps nagging at me. I feel like we're missing something crucial about how these should work together.
